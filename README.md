## What is this?

When I started learning Latin, I was unironically shocked by the
fact that it was hard to find copies of old books that used the dead
language. This project aims to overcome this issue by printing old
books requested by you (the reader) with or without translation.
Requests will usually be responded to within 3 days.

All the content inside the books sold here are free use unless
explicitly mentioned otherwise.

This project is ran by Vithushan (aka me) and I just felt the need
to say that. Anyway, check out my site at [lewoof.xyz](https://lewoof.xyz).

## Request books

You can request books by emailing me (or messaging me on other platforms)
details about the book you want. Make sure the content you want in the book
are available in the public domain.
